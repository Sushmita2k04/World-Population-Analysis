![Alt Text](https://github.com/Sushmita2k04/World-Population-Analysis/blob/main/Task1.png)
Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this task is **world_population_dataset**. This dataset contains records of population from the year **2001 to 2022**.

## **Tools and Libraries Used**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

### **1. Data Cleaning**
Checked for:
- Missing values
- Duplicates
- Outliers

Handled them accordingly.

### **2. Visualization**
Created:
- Bar chart

These visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## **Conclusion**
In conclusion, this EDA process provided valuable insights into the distribution of the selected variable in the dataset. This analysis lays the foundation for further exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.
